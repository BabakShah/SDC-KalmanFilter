# Self-Driving Car Project: Designing a Kalman Filter

Hello there! I'm Babak. Let me introduce you to my project. In this project I created a Kalman filter with a matrix class and ran the filter on simulated LiDAR data and visualized the results. Kalman filters are used to reduce noise in the sensor data and sensor fusion in a self-driving car. This project was written using Python object oriented programming.
